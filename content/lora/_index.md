LoRa (Long Range) technology has gained significant traction for its low-power, long-range wireless communication capabilities.
However, like any technology, it is not immune to vulnerabilities. Over the years, several Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) have been identified related to LoRa implementations.   
{{< /lead >}}


- Frequency Band	868 MHz (Europe), 915 MHz (North America), 920 MHz (Asia)	Operating frequency of the LoRa device
- Data Rate	SF7 to SF12	Spreading factor used for modulation, affecting range and data rate
- Bandwidth	125 kHz, 250 kHz, 500 kHz	Bandwidth of the transmitted signal
- Modulation	LoRa	Proprietary modulation scheme for long-range, low-power communication
- Maximum Output Power	20 dBm	Maximum power level the device can transmit
- Sensitivity	-142 dBm	Minimum signal strength the device can receive
- Range	Up to 15 km (urban), up to 50 km (rural)	Maximum distance the device can communicate
- Data Rate and Range Trade-off	Higher spreading factor (SF) increases range but decreases data rate, and vice versa	
- Duty Cycle	1% (maximum)	Limits the amount of time the device can transmit to conserve battery life
- Power Consumption	Low-power mode: µA, Transmit mode: mA	Typical power consumption in different operating modes
