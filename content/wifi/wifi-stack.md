## Physical Layer (PHY)
The foundation handles the actual transmission of radio waves.

- Encoding and decoding data into electrical signals.
- Modulating and demodulating signals to carry information.
- Frequency hopping to avoid interference.
## Media Access Control (MAC) Layer
The traffic cop manages access to the shared wireless medium. Â  

- Assigning time slots to devices for transmission.
- Detecting and resolving collisions.
- Handling frame synchronization.
## Logical Link Control (LLC) Layer
The bridge connects the MAC layer to the higher-level network protocols.

- Flow control to prevent overwhelming the receiver.
- Error detection and correction.
- Multiplexing data from multiple applications.
## Internet Protocol (IP) Layer
The navigator provides addressing and routing for data packets.

- Assigning IP addresses to devices.
- Routing packets through the internet.
- Fragmenting and reassembling packets if necessary.
## Transport Layer
The delivery service ensures reliable data transfer between applications.

- Establishing connections between devices.
- Flow control to prevent data loss.
- Error detection and correction.
