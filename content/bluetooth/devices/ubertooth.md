Unauthorized access to data on a Bluetooth-enabled device.
{{< /lead >}}

## Description

Bluesnarfing is a type of hacking that involves using Bluetooth technology to gain unauthorized access to a device. It's similar to phishing, but instead of using email or websites, it exploits the wireless connection between devices.

### How it works

- Pairing: The attacker tries to pair their device with your device. This can be done without your knowledge, as many devices automatically attempt to pair with nearby devices.
- Data access: Once paired, the attacker can access data stored on your device, including contacts, messages, photos, and even sensitive information like passwords.
- Malware installation: In some cases, the attacker can install malicious software on your device, which can be used to further compromise your security.
