Taking control of a Bluetooth-enabled device.
{{< /lead >}}

## Description
Bluebugging is another type of Bluetooth-based hacking that involves taking control of a mobile device remotely. Unlike bluesnarfing, which focuses on data theft, bluebugging aims to hijack the entire device.

### How it works

Pairing: The attacker pairs their device with the target device, often without the user's knowledge.
Control: Once paired, the attacker can remotely control the target device, performing actions like making calls, sending messages, and accessing the device's camera and microphone.
Malware installation: Similar to bluesnarfing, the attacker can also install malicious software on the target device to gain further control or steal data.

### Prevention tips

- Disable Bluetooth when not in use: This is the most effective way to prevent bluebugging.
- Be cautious about pairing: Only pair with devices you trust.
- Use strong passwords: Protect your device with a strong password to make it more difficult for attackers to access.
- Keep your device updated: Ensure that your device's operating system and apps are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
- Use a Bluetooth security app: Some apps can help protect your device from bluebugging by scanning for unauthorized pairing attempts.
