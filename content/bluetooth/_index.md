## Best Practices for Bluetooth Security
- Keep Bluetooth Off When Not in Use: This prevents accidental connections and reduces the attack surface.
- Use Strong PIN Codes: Choose complex PIN codes that are difficult to guess.
- Enable Pairing Code Verification: Require a PIN code to be entered on both devices during pairing.
- Keep Devices Updated: Ensure your devices have the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
- Be Cautious About Accepting Incoming Connections: Only accept connections from trusted devices.
- Use Reputable Bluetooth Accessories: Avoid purchasing accessories from unknown or untrusted sources.
- Avoid Public Bluetooth Networks: Public networks can be more susceptible to attacks.
- Consider Using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): BLE offers enhanced security features and lower power consumption.
